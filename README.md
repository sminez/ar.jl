Simulating The Dynamics of a Relativistic Fluid
===============================================

The code in this repoisitory is a work to simulate the dynamics
of the relativistic fluid theorised by Dr J.G.Williamson.

Some files are simulations of classical EM as a proof of concept
in using Julia to simulate this kind of mathematics.

Roadmap
-------
- [ ] Demo animated Julia plotting from time-step updating fields
- [ ] Simulate 1D Maxwell EM
- [ ] Simulate 2D Maxwell EM
- [ ] Simulate 3D Maxwell EM

Further Down The Line...
------------------------
- [ ] Grok the Theory...!
- [ ] Develop Williamson update equations
- [ ] Benchmark the complexity of updating Williamson vs Maxwell
- [ ] Full simulation but (1|2|3)D plot of Williamson
- [ ] Start with electron field configuration and run time back
